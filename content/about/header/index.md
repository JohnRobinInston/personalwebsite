I'm a postgraduate student originally from Manchester, England.  I studied my bachelor's degree in mathematics with statistics at Lancaster before working as a trainee tax advisor in Altrincham.  After 2 years I decided to return to university to pursue a career as a quantitative analyst and data scientist.  I am currently working to obtain my masters degree in quantitative finance with plans on graduating later this year.
