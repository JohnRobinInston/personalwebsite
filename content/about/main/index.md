  I am currently working on my dissertation as past of my master's programme.  I am investigating the use of machine learning techniques - such as k-means clustering and self-organising maps - in predicting the survival capacity of mutual funds.
  
  My plans going forward are to continue to develop my skills as a quantitative analysts.  I aim to continue my research into the applications of machine learning techniques in investment management by pursuing PhD study in North America.
