# Projects

### 1.  Implementing Black-Scholes and Vasiciek Models

For this project we implement the Black-Scholes and Vasiciek models in order to determine the price of both European call options on stock and the price of bonds.
 
### 2.  Calculating Value-at-Risk using GARCH models.

For this project we calculate the Value-at-Risk (VaR) of FTSE100 time series data using fitted Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity Models.

### 3. High-Frequency Stock Trade-Quote Data Analysis.

For this group project we analyse the tick-by-tick and open-to-close log returns of a stock and find the best model in the ARMA-GARCH modelling framework.  We then construct a volatility signature plot with daily realised volatility estimator and compute the rolling window, one-step-ahead volatility forecast with the ARMA-GARCH models and a HAR-RV specification.

### 4. Value-at-Risk Forecasting and Backtesting.

For this project we calculate the daily 5% Value-at-Risk (VaR) of the Dow Jones Industrial Average over a period of 7 years.  We then perform backtesting to compare our risk models, checking periods of high volatility as well as checking coverage and independence.
