intro: |
  My name is John and I am a mathematician, statistician and data scientist from Manchester, England.  I am currently pursuing a career as a quantitative analyst in the asset management sector.  I have a bachelors degree in Mathematics and Statistics from Lancaster University and I am currently studying a masters Quantitative Finance degree at Lancaster University and am on track for obtaining a distinction level result.  
  
I spend most of my time coding or working with data and I have excellent knowledge of the R, Python, MATLAB and SAS coding languages and have used all 4 to analyse financial time series.  Outside of work I have a passion for technology, youtube, photography and music.  I tutor mathematics online and have recently begun writing and filming videos about science on my youtube channel.
